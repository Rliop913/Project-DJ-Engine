# Project_DJ_Engine
This is an audio engine implemented in software by replicating the DJ's mixing method.

It supports real-time mixing and is lightweight enough to be used in rhythm games.

The libraries and languages ​​used for implementation are Miniaudio, SoundTouch, Faust Language, and JsonCPP. Among these, some libraries include LGPL licenses, so this engine is also subject to the LGPL 2.1 license.

I confirmed that normal mixing is possible with an audio buffer size of 48 based on the 48000SR on the i7-10750 CPU.
