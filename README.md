# Project-DJ-Engine

This project is a DJ/rhythm game engine written in C++. All sources live under `include/`.

## Document

See **[document Website](https://rliop913.github.io/Project-DJ-Engine/)**

## Building

Prerequisites:

- C++20 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.12 or later
- SWIG
- OpenSSL
- [Conan](https://conan.io/)
  
To build the engine:

on linux & macos
```bash
bash ./BuildInitwithConan.sh . Release
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../conan_cmakes/conan_toolchain.cmake" -DPDJE_DYNAMIC=OFF #to get dynamic library, change here
cmake --build . --parallel #add your maximum number of cores
```
on windows
```cmd
./BuildInitwithConan.bat . static Release
::to get dynamic library, change static into dynamic
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../conan_cmakes/conan_toolchain.cmake" -DPDJE_DYNAMIC=OFF #to get dynamic library, change here
cmake --build . --config Release --parallel #add your maximum number of cores
```

> ⚠️ **WARNING**  
> To change the build type (Debug/Release) or switch between static and dynamic builds,  
> you must re-run the `BuildInitwithConan` script with the new options.  
> Otherwise, Conan dependencies may not be configured correctly.
> 
> If you plan to build Swig binding, you should use dynamic build on windows. static build may cause link errors.
