The Spin effect adjusts the speed of the music without time-stretching, creating a dynamic playback modification. 
Once the spin effect ends, the music resumes playback from the point it would have reached if the effect had not been applied, ensuring a seamless transition in progression.

This effect is inspired by the distinctive sound created by DJs when they spin a disc forward or backward, producing a unique and iconic audio signature.
